	  <p>I am Christine Cai(-square distributed), a third-year <font color="darkred">Ph.D. Student in Economics</font> at <font color="darkred">Princeton University</font>.</p>
	
		<p>My research interests lie in <font color="darkred">applied microeconomics</font> 
			and span <font color="darkred">labor, education, urban, public, and health economics</font>.
			I am particularly interested in issues related to segregation, migrations, educational inequalities, and social mobility.</p>
	
<p><font color="darkred">Before the start of my Ph.D. program</font>, I worked as a full-time <font color="darkred">research assistant</font> for 
			<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rebecca.dizon-ross/">Professor Rebecca Dizon-Ross</a>
	at the University of <font color="darkred">Chicago Booth</font> School of Business.</p>
	
<p>My <font color="darkred">rÃ©sumÃ©</font> can be viewed/downloaded <a href="/resume/Christine_Cai_resume.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I can be reached at <font color="darkred">christine.cai@princeton.edu</font>. Otherwise, if you happen to visit Princeton, I can be found in office 264 located in the Industrial Relations Section (on the second floor of the Department of Economics building). These days though, I am mostly wandering around Zoomland...!</p>
