	<h1>Hi, welcome to my webpage!</h1>
	<p>My name is Christine Cai and I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Princeton University.</p>
	<p>My research interests (which are subject to changes...!) currently lie in applied microeconomics (this broader subfield is unlikely to change though!) 
		and in particular, education/labor, development, and urban economics.
		I am notably interested in issues related to educational inequalities, social mobility, and segregation.</p>
