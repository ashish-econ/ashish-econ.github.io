	<h1>Hi, welcome to my webpage!</h1>
	
	<p>My name is Christine Cai and I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Princeton University.</p>
	
	<p>My research interests (which might be subject to changes...!) currently lie in applied microeconomics (this field of interest is unlikely to change though!) 
		and include education/labor, development, and urban economics.
		I am notably interested in issues related to educational inequalities, social mobility, and segregation.</p>
	
	<p>I previously worked as a full-time research assistant for 
		<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rebecca.dizon-ross/">Professor Rebecca Dizon-Ross</a>
		at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (2016-2018) and for 
		<a href="https://www.rubendurante.net">Professor Ruben Durante</a>
		at the Department of Economics of Sciences Po Paris (2015-2016).</p>
	
	<p>I hold a Master's degree in Economics from Sciences Po Paris. I wrote my Master's thesis – 
		entitled 'Colonial Administrators and Public Educational Investments in French West Africa' – 
		under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/">Professor Quoc-Anh Do</a>, 
		and successfully defended it in July 2015 [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/eks0j9nua2zxp42/paper.pdf?dl=0">paper</a>] 
		[<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/01fgq1xrp4dd900/slides.pdf?dl=0">slides</a>].</p>
