		<p>Hello, welcome to my webpage!</p>
	
	<p>I'm Christine, a rising second-year <font color="darkred">Ph.D. Student in Economics</font> at <font color="darkred">Princeton University</font>. I am currently working with <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/lboustan/home">Professor Leah P. Boustan</a> over the summer.</p>
	
		<p>My research interests lie in <font color="darkred">applied microeconomics</font> 
			and currently span <font color="darkred">education/labor, development, and urban economics</font>.
			I am particularly interested in issues related to educational inequalities, social mobility, segregation, and migration.</p>
	
<p>I <font color="darkred">previously</font> worked as a full-time <font color="darkred">research assistant</font> for 
			<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rebecca.dizon-ross/">Professor Rebecca Dizon-Ross</a>
	at the University of <font color="darkred">Chicago Booth</font> School of Business (2016-2018) and for 
			<a href="https://www.rubendurante.net">Professor Ruben Durante</a>
	at the Department of Economics of <font color="darkred">Sciences Po</font> Paris (2015-2016).</p>
	
<p>I hold a <font color="darkred">Master's degree in Economics</font> from Sciences Po Paris. I wrote my Master's thesis – 
			entitled 'Colonial Administrators and Public Educational Investments in French West Africa' – 
			under the supervision of <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/qaquocanhdo/">Professor Quoc-Anh Do</a>, 
			and successfully defended it in July 2015 [<a href="/masters thesis/paper.pdf">paper</a>] 
			[<a href="/masters thesis/slides.pdf">slides</a>].</p>
	
<p>My <font color="darkred">résumé</font> can be viewed/downloaded <a href="/resume/resume_website.pdf">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I can be reached at <font color="darkred">christine.cai@princeton.edu</font>    
		(or, if you happen to visit Princeton ^^, I can be found in the second-year Ph.D. students' office (A16) located in the basement of the Department of Economics building).</p>
	
		<p>Finally, if you'd like to, you can <a href="https://twitter.com/Christine_Cai27">follow me on Twitter</a> :).</p>
	
		PS: If you took a guess, my profile picture was taken in Chicago. Specifically, it was taken in May 2018, a few days before quitting my RA job there ;( ...!
