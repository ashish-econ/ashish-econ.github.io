	<h1>Hi, welcome to my webpage!</h1>
	
	<p>My name is Christine Cai and I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. Candidate in Economics at Princeton University.</p>
	
	<p>My research interests (which are subject to changes...!) currently lie in applied microeconomics (this broader subfield is unlikely to change though!) 
		and in particular, education/labor, development, and urban economics.
		I am notably interested in issues related to educational inequalities, social mobility, and segregation.</p>
	
	<p>I previously worked as a full-time research assistant for 
		<a href="http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/rebecca.dizon-ross/">Professor Rebecca Dizon-Ross</a>
		at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business (2016-2018) and for 
		<a href="https://www.rubendurante.net">Professor Ruben Durante</a>
		at the Department of Economics of Sciences Po Paris (2015-2016).</p>
	
	<p>I hold a Master's degree in Economics as well as a Bachelor's degree in Economics, both from Sciences Po Paris.</p>
	
	<p>My résumé can be viewed/downloaded <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mrxir24ojigm5g4/resume_website.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>
